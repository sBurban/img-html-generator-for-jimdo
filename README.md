This is a personal project created to facilitate using images in older version of JIMDO CMS.

Users input URL inside the textbox, then select a Template option (full width, half width, or No Width) for the image. The page will generate an HTML fragment which can be copy-pasted into a JIMDO text box when editing as HTML.

Used libraries:

1.[github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)
=> For minimal styling when presenting the HTML fragment

2.[Google Fonts for Icons](https://fonts.google.com/)

3.[Handlebars](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/handlebars@latest/dist/handlebars.js)
=> For templates string handling
