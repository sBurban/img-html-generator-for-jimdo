This is a personal project created to facilitate using images in older version of JIMDO CMS.

Users input URL inside the textbox, then select a Template option (full width, half width, or No Width) for the image. The page will generate an HTML fragment which can be copy-pasted into a JIMDO text box when editing as HTML.

Used libraries:
1.github-markdown-css: for minimal styling when presenting the HTML fragment
https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css

2.Google Fonts for Icons
https://fonts.google.com/

3.Handlebars: for templates string handling
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/handlebars@latest/dist/handlebars.js
